This repository contains examples of most popular design pattern written in C#.

## Observer pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

The example describes the marketplace where a user can see some products and subscribe to their price updates.
Another observer (or subscriber) is a product price history class which stores the values of the product price and the date of change.

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

The example describes a payment system which allows a user to pay by card, PayPal or with Cryptocurrency and get check if required.
