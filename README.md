## Observer pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

The example describes the marketplace where a user can see some products and subscribe to their price updates.
Another observer (or subscriber) is a product price history class which stores the values of the product price and the date of change.
